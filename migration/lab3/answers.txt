sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: 
When the array is sorted, bubble sort only has to iterate over the array once. 
This means that the bubble sort algorithm would finish significantly faster with a sorted array than with a random or reversed array.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?:
Merge sort takes about the same amout of time to finish whether the array is sorted, reversed or randomized. 
As the size of the array increases, the running time will increase roughly linearly 

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?:
Selection sort takes about the same amount of time whether the array is sorted, random or reversed.
As the size of the array increases, the running time will increase exponentially
